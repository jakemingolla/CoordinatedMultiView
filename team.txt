Dorian Pistilli && Jake Mingolla

- Jake is one wiz kid. He loves processing, he loves creative thinking,
he loves finding solutions, but most of all, he loves Dorian. 

- Dorian is incredibly specific about his pixels. But there's only one
specific that matters most to him. And that's the feelings and teamwork
shared between him and Jake.

What great guys, the two of them. They worked together and, more
importantly, grew together as well.
